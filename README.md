# Programming Assignment 4 - README

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook analyzes student performance data using Python and the pandas library. It focuses on filtering and manipulating datasets based on student tracks, hometowns, and scores in subjects such as Electronics and GEAS.

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Filtering**: Specific filters are applied to extract data based on:
    - Student track (e.g., Instrumentation)
    - Hometown (e.g., Luzon)
    - Subject scores (e.g., Electronics > 70)
3. **Data Manipulation**: 
    - Data is filtered and displayed for specific requirements (e.g., students from Luzon in Instrumentation track with Electronics scores above 70).
4. **Output**: The resulting dataset is displayed in a structured format, showing students' names, GEAS, and Electronics scores.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas library

## Running the Notebook
1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install pandas`.
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter: `jupyter notebook PA4_BON-AO.ipynb`.
3. Run the cells to see the data analysis in action.

## File Description
- **PA4_BON-AO.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook for Programming Assignment 4, containing all the code for data analysis.
